TS1-HTMLPlaygroundAPImock.spec.js

This suite tests the "Iframe API Data Loader" feature, a local HTML page that fetches user data from an API and populates an iframe. It verifies that API data is correctly retrieved, displayed in a textarea, and rendered inside the iframe, including mock responses and UI updates.

Coverage:

1. "API Data Fetching": Confirms that the textarea loads user data from '/api/users' on page load.
2. "Textarea Value Verification": Validates that the textarea contains expected user entries such as "Mock User" or "Test User".
3. "Iframe Population": Checks that clicking the PopulateIframe button writes the textarea content into the iframe.
4. "Mock API Interception": Demonstrates route interception to supply mock user data ('Test User 1', 'Test User 2') for testing without relying on a live backend.
5. "Iframe Content Verification": Ensures the iframe body contains the expected user names from the API response.
6. "Reload Handling": Confirms the page reload does not break the API load and iframe population logic.
7. "Visual Verification": Captures screenshots before and after populating the iframe for traceability and CI reporting.

Techniques Demonstrated:

* Page automation with Playwright ('page.goto', 'page.locator', 'page.click')
* Frame handling via 'frameLocator' for verifying live content
* Mocking API responses using 'page.route' and 'route.fulfill'
* Assertions on dynamic UI updates (textarea value and iframe content)
* Screenshots for pre/post-action validation and CI attachments

Purpose: Ensures the HTML page correctly fetches and displays API data, supports testing with mock data, and renders the content in an iframe consistently across reloads and interactions.
