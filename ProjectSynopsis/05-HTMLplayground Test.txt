TS1-HTMLPlayground.spec.js

This suite tests the "HTML Playground" feature, a local HTML editor with live preview in an iframe. It verifies input handling, live rendering, cross-browser/device behavior, and basic formatting support. The suite uses Playwright page automation and frame locators to simulate user interactions and validate iframe content.

Coverage:

1. "UI Availability": Confirms the textarea and Run button are visible and contain expected default values.
2. "Default Content Verification": Ensures the textarea initially contains '<p>Hello Playwright!</p>'.
3. "HTML Input Handling": Validates that user-entered HTML is accepted by the textarea.
4. "Live Rendering in Iframe": Checks that clicking the Run button renders the updated HTML in the iframe.
5. "Formatting Support": Verifies that HTML tags (e.g., '<b>', '<i>', '<p>') are correctly rendered.
6. "Cross-Browser Verification": Confirms the feature works on Chromium, Firefox (desktop only for mobile viewports), and WebKit.
7. "Cross-Device Verification": Tests functionality on Desktop, Mobile, and Pixel 5 viewport/device settings.
8. "Visual Verification": Captures screenshots before and after running HTML code for traceability and validation.

Techniques Demonstrated:

* Page automation using Playwright ('page.goto', 'page.fill', 'page.click')
* Frame handling via 'frameLocator' for live HTML content verification
* Cross-browser and responsive/device testing
* Screenshots for pre/post-render visual validation and error attachments
* Reusable test function ('iframeTest') for DRY test design

Purpose: Ensures the HTML Playground allows users to enter, edit, and preview HTML accurately, and works consistently across browsers and devices with proper rendering in an iframe.
